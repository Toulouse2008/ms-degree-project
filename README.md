This is the project for my master degree in computer science. The project contains
two parts:
    1. The webapp build with MEAN framework
    2. The module to retrieve and store data for stock historical price into MySQl.
This is the part 1.

Introduction
    For years, there had been some free online service by which people could easily track
the historical price of stocks. For example, yahoo-finance and google-finance had
been the two most widely used of them. Even though we had to go through all
of their commercials, we accept the torture.
    Things changed these days! Google has shut down their service for historical
stock price, and yahoo has taken down its service too.
    Facing this reality, people who are investing in the stock market will not have
access to historical data sooner or later. There's a need that people can have
their own source for historical data.

    And that is why I start this project under the supervisor of Prof. Chen.

Skills needed in the project:
    1. NodeJS:  
    2. Express:
    3. MongoDb: database for user registration, but can be easily moved to mysql
    4. Angular 4:
    5. AJAX:    Ajax is used for data communication between front end and back end


How to run the project?
    To set up the project, install MongoDB 3.4, MySQL 5.16, Angular 4.x and
    NodeJS 8.10 or later.
    Fire up procedure:
        1. Start MongoDB server  
        2. Start MySQL server  
        3. Start node server: $node app.js
        4. Start Angular: $ng serve
            http://localhost:4200
